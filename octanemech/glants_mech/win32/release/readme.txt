Sept 14, 2002 - I basically revamped the entire system, it has
kind of a cyber look.  Collision detection doesnt work 100% now
but it looks a little cooler.  It even looks like a game.
The next update will have a lot more stuff, also.  It is only been
a month, have fun....

There are some bugs to watch out for, I dont mean to leave
bugs but they are little things.  If you get stuck in a box, 
restart the program.  Collision detection may or may not work.
Collisions on the objects are tested before collisions on the 
bots, so a collision may occur before hitting a bot but really
you hit a bot.


Sept 4, 2002 - Once again, I added a whole new look, including
a camera to follow the ship.  It is not that spectacular because
the camera gets a little annoying.  Also added some gameplay

August 27, 2002 - There has been a lot added but
it may be hard for you to tell that.  On a top level,
enemy characters have been added, but they only shoot themselves
In some ways they go after the weaker of the fire ants.  They
do not effect the worker ants at all.

Changes:
 - Gave fire ants the ability to shoot
 - Added particle engine, very simple

This is the framework for glants.  It is the underbelly of
what the program will be.  Right now I can test stuff without
too much fuzz because most changes are made in source and
then recompiled.  

Instructions -

Use the arrow keys to move around the world and watch the
ants
