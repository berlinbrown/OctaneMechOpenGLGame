 - Added simple networking and sound support.
 In order to get network working, you pretty much have to follow
 these steps exactly.
 Oh yeah, the server doesnt display the client movements(not done yet)
 1. on client side: start glants
 2. on server side: start glants
 3. on server side: select settings->start server->wait for connects
 4. on client side: connect to server
 5. on server side: press esc->select new game, server is in motion
 6. play game, that is it

** Instructions **
There is a pre-compiled version of glants in this directory.
It probably will not work, but you can try it with
 
 	./glants

Or the best way is to do a clean and then make with
	make clean
	make

and run ./glants again. 

Of course you have to make sure that OPENGL/MESA is installed
as well as GLX and of course update xwindows.  I installed
the nvidia drivers for opengl and the program ran ok on 
my 400mhz machine.   I think the linux version runs a little better
than the windows version<shrug>.

You can edit the config.ini file to change the speed of the game
or how many characters you fight against.
